## About Me
I love computers, eating, taking walks, and hanging out with my friends, as well as playing and making tabletop and video games! I want to learn about how to build a good website.
## Past Coding Experience
C++ - 1 year, C# - 2 years
## Career Goals
#### 1. Become a successful game developer and enjoy life.
#### 2. Become a successful web developer so I can do something I enjoy. Not starving when games don't produce income would also be nice.
